=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Search::GIN::Query::Class;

    my $query = Search::GIN::Query::Class->new(
        class => 'Person',
    );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Creates a class-based GIN query that can be used to search records in a storage.

This is a ready-to-use query that uses class definitions (specifically C<class>,
C<does> and C<blessed>) to search through the storage.

=head1 METHODS/SUBROUTINES

=head2 new

Creates a new query.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 class

The class of the object you want to find.

    my $query = Search::GIN::Query::Class->new(
        class => 'Person',
    );

=head2 does

A role consumed by the object you want to find.

    my $query = Search::GIN::Query::Class->new(
        does => 'TheMonkey',
    );

=head2 blessed

The name of the package that the object is blessed into.

    my $query = Search::GIN::Query::Class->new(
        blessed => 'Person',
    );
